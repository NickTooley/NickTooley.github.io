<h3>A detailed report of my technical proficiency during the Leave Management project, including evidence and examples of my work.</h3>
<br />

Our project was built from PHP and heavily utilizes a MariaDB server running PHPMyAdmin. We spent the holiday break researching different PHP frameworks, and I liked the look of CodeIgniter. I completed the tutorial for CodeIgniter and tried implementing some of my existing code into it, and I realized a lot of refactoring would have to take place. Along with that, additional learning for both myself and the rest of the team, who were already learning basic PHP, would be required so it made more sense to just stick to standard vanilla PHP with no framework as we knew we could make it work with all team members having some input.<br /><br />
I wanted to get the project up and running as soon as possible so I coded up a platform which contained all the basic requirement with a couple of additional features (email, additional info page). This first release had just the base functionality and absolutely no styling. Here are some screenshots of the first release which will give you some idea of how basic it was:<br /><br />

I coded the entire first release alone, this meant I had to create a database model, implement it, as well as write all the queries to add, edit and retrieve information from the database and adding those into the PHP code. My original database model, along with that first release, was quite barebones and upon our project becoming more and more sophisticated, so did my database model. The database required a lot more tables and as such, a lot of normalization to ensure data wasn’t repeated and there weren’t too many null fields. The database also contains fields  to future-proof the project for more features down the road (according to our Trello board).<br /><br />
Here is the original Database UML diagram:<br /><br />

Our version control was used through git. We took some time to get this finally implemented, but once we did we came up with a fairly sophisticated workflow that Albert came up with. It involved having a development server and a live server with the git repos in each. We would pull from the repo every time we committed on the development server and then at the end of our weekly sprints we would spend some time ensuring it was all working fine and then pulling from the repo into the live server. It became coming quite tedious pulling from the repo to the development server every time we committed, so I created a bash script which called the git pull command every 10 seconds (we later upped this to 30 seconds to reduce load on the Kate server) and Albert implemented a Linux screen service which kept this script running at all times. Once we had all this implemented, I utilized this workflow to the maximum with frequent commits with clear concise commit messages as seen here:<br /><br />

One of our user stories that I was interested in implementing was: "As a lecturer, I would like to upload a new stream of students using a csv file". The act of reading from a csv I was very familiar with from prior courses, so I had no issues with this, however, the uploading and then subsequent reading was a process I was largely unfamiliar with. I started to search around looking for answers and came across a multitude of assistance from the various forums out there (stack overflow, w3, etc.) which helped me getting this feature functional. It proved even more difficult than a lot of these tutorials suggested as the PHP configuration on the Kate server wouldn't allow for file uploads, so I had to utilize some ingenuity and find a work around for this. I realized that the file itself didn't actually need to be stored on the server past the initial reading so I was able to do this by reading directly from the tmp file which is automatically stored on the server following a file input .<br /><br />
Overall, this project provided me a great opportunity to learn new things, put into practice a lot of stuff I had learnt previously as well as providing a teaching opportunity for the rest of my team members.
