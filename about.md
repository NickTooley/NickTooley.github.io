This is Nick Tooley's portfolio for Semester 1 2018 Software Engineering. My project was the Leave Management Software with Elise Allen as the client.<br /><br />
My other team members were:<br />
 - Fletcher Barratt<br />
 - Albert Tireck<br />
 - Coen Edwards<br />
 - Henry Cooper<br /><br />
 
 The project took place over a 13 week period (including a 2 week holiday period) from the beginning of April to mid-June 2018.<br />
